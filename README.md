# CipherSQLStudio – SQL Practice Platform

## Overview
CipherSQLStudio is a browser-based SQL learning platform where users can attempt SQL assignments, write queries, view results, and receive intelligent hints.

This project focuses on backend architecture, API design, and overall system flow rather than full production deployment.

## Features Implemented
- Assignment listing API
- Structured backend using Node.js and Express
- Database schema design for assignments and sample data
- Separation of routes and controllers
- Data Flow Diagram for query execution

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: SQL Server / MySQL (schema-level)
- Frontend: React.js (planned)
- Styling: SCSS (planned)

## Data Flow
1. User selects an assignment
2. Frontend sends request to backend
3. Backend executes SQL query
4. Results are returned to frontend

## Note
Due to local environment constraints, full database connectivity is not demonstrated. However, the project architecture, data flow, and implementation logic are complete and reflect real-world design principles.
